So I've been recording myself lately with this old tape recorder. Not because I need to or something, but because it's a way to pass the time and keep track of things. Itâ€™s kind of comforting, just hitting record and letting my thoughts spill out to it, even if no one ever hears them.

I don't know why I started doing this, maybe it's just nice to have something constant, a way to capture these quiet moments. It's like creating a little archive of my days, even if they're mostly the same. Who knows, maybe one day I'll look back and find something meaningful in all these tapes.
