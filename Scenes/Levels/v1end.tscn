Today dragged on... The walk back was more unsettling than usual; I didn't see anyone, not even in the windows. Felt like I was the only person outside. It did creep me out a bit, but it also felt kind of nice...
I'm starting to feel like I'm not welcome in my own apartment anymore. Even when sleeping, I feel like my dreams are telling me to get out.
I think I'll go to Grandma's tomorrow, I miss her.
