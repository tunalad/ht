# Helen's Tapes

This "game" is just an album visualizer really, so the whole project is pretty much just a fancy and pretty basic music player.

It can get it from [itch.io](tunalad.itch.io/helens-tapes), or [releases](https://github.com/tunalad/ht/releases) here on GitHub.

**do note that you won't be getting the whole game on GitHub, you'll still have to manually get the `.pck` files separately**

---

Scenes are generated based on the `vol.json` file, when we open the game. It is also possible to create your own volumes by creating your own `.pck` file! Instructions can be found on the itch.io page, by downloading the `Custom Volumes Instructions` PDF file.

Other interesting thing that you might find interesting is the developer console (`DevConsole.tscn`). It is designed to be pretty simple and applicabe to any game (of course, you stll have to modify it with your own game's functionalities)
